# Benford's Law
The purpose of this project is to check whether a given data set follows the distribution of Benford's Law

## Background
Benford's Law is an observation about the frequency distribution of the leading digits of a number from a table of physical constants or statistical data where the probability of digit `1` to occur is about 30.1% rather than 10% as one might expects if all digits were equally likely. 

This implies that a number in a statistical data or a table of physical constants is more likely to begin nwith smaller digit than larger ones. 

## Project Structure
This project consist of only one Java class called `Benford` that contains the `Main()` method and five additional methods that help to determine whether the data in the dataset follows Benford's Law.

The dataset to be analyzed named `data.txt` is located in the same directory as `Benford.java` source code.

For more information about the class methods and fields, please go to the Wiki section of this project.
